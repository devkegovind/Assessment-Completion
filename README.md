**Q-1. Imagine you have a dataset where you have different Instagram features like u sername , Caption , Hashtag , Followers , Time_Since_posted , and likes , now your task is to predict the number of likes and Time Since posted and the rest of the features are your input features. Now you have to build a model which can predict the number of likes and Time Since posted. Dataset This is the Dataset You can use this dataset for this question.**

#### **About Dataset**

**Content**

The dataset contains 101 rows and 6 main features namely 'UserName', 'Caption', 'Followers', 'HashTags', 'Time Since Posted', 'Likes'. By now you must have understood the target feature or value to be predicted is the Likes column which has been referred to as "reach" so far.
When Do people get more likes on a social media platform like Instagram?
When a User has more followers, then the post reaches out to more peoples and chances are more to get more likes. To identify a linear relationship in data and build a simple Machine Learning model and put your best foot forward toward Machine Learning.

## News Category Dataset

Identify the type of news based on headlines and short descriptions


**About Dataset**

*Context*
**Please cite the dataset using the BibTex provided in one of the following sections if you are using it in your research, thank you!**

This dataset contains around 210k news headlines from 2012 to 2022 from HuffPost. This is one of the biggest news datasets and can serve as a benchmark for a variety of computational linguistic tasks. HuffPost stopped maintaining an extensive archive of news articles sometime after this dataset was first collected in 2018, so it is not possible to collect such a dataset in the present day. Due to changes in the website, there are about 200k headlines between 2012 and May 2018 and 10k headlines between May 2018 and 2022.

*Content*
Each record in the dataset consists of the following attributes:

- category: category in which the article was published.
- headline: the headline of the news article.
- authors: list of authors who contributed to the article.
- link: link to the original news article.
- short_description: Abstract of the news article.
- date: publication date of the article.
There are a total of 42 news categories in the dataset. The top-15 categories and corresponding article counts are as follows:

POLITICS: 35602

WELLNESS: 17945

ENTERTAINMENT: 17362

TRAVEL: 9900

STYLE & BEAUTY: 9814

PARENTING: 8791

HEALTHY LIVING: 6694

QUEER VOICES: 6347

FOOD & DRINK: 6340

BUSINESS: 5992

COMEDY: 5400

SPORTS: 5077

BLACK VOICES: 4583

HOME & LIVING: 4320

PARENTS: 3955

Inspiration
Can you categorize news articles based on their headlines and short descriptions?

Do news articles from different categories have different writing styles?

A classifier trained on this dataset could be used on a free text to identify the type of language being used.

Online Shopper Intention Dataset from UCI's Machine Learning Library

**About Dataset**
*Data Set Information:*

The dataset consists of feature vectors belonging to 12,330 sessions.
The dataset was formed so that each session
would belong to a different user in a 1-year period to avoid
any tendency to a specific campaign, special day, user
profile, or period.

**Q-5. Uber is a taxi service provider as we know, we need to predict the high booking area using an Unsupervised algorithm and price for the location using a supervised algorithm and use some map function to display the data Dataset This is the Dataset You can use this dataset for this question.**

**About Dataset**
*Uber vs Lyft*
- This is a very beginner-friendly dataset. It does contain a lot of NA values. It is a good dataset if you want to use a Linear Regression Model to see the pattern between different predectors such as hour and price.

- A really amazing part of this dataset is that I have included the corresponding weather data for that hour with a short summary of the weather. Other important factors are temperature, wind, and sunset.


**Q-6. Imagine you have a dataset where you have predicted loan Eligibility using any 4 different classification algorithms.

**Problem Statement:**
About Company
Dream Housing Finance company deals in all home loans. They have presence across all urban, semi urban and rural areas. Customer first apply for home loan after that company validates the customer eligibility for loan.

**Problem**
Company wants to automate the loan eligibility process (real time) based on customer detail provided while filling online application form. These details are Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History and others. To automate this process, they have given a problem to identify the customers segments, those are eligible for loan amount so that they can specifically target these customers. Here they have provided a partial data set.


**Q-7.

**Music features**
A dataset to test your music tagging model

**About Dataset**

*Context*
A music genre is a conventional category that identifies pieces of music as belonging to a shared tradition or set of conventions. It is to be distinguished from musical form and musical style. The features extracted from these waves can help the machine distinguish between them.

*Content*
The features in this dataset are extracted from the dataset provided here which consists of 1000 audio tracks each 30 seconds long. It contains 10 genres, each represented by 100 tracks. The tracks are all 22050Hz Mono 16-bit audio files in .wav format. The code used to extract features is at this GitHub repo. Features are extracted using libROSA library.

*Acknowledgements*
The credits to this dataset go to MARSYAS.

*Inspiration*
Due to the artistic nature of music, the classifications are often arbitrary and controversial, and some genres may overlap. Train a model and know to which genre your favourite piece of music belong to.
