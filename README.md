**Q.1**

#### **Problem Statment**

Imagine you have a dataset where you have different Instagram features like u sername , Caption , Hashtag , Followers , Time_Since_posted , and likes , now your task is to predict the number of likes and Time Since posted and the rest of the features are your input features. Now you have to build a model which can predict the
number of likes and Time Since posted.
Dataset This is the Dataset You can use this dataset for this question.

#### **About Dataset**

**Content**

The dataset contains 101 rows and 6 main features namely 'UserName', 'Caption', 'Followers', 'HashTags', 'Time Since Posted', 'Likes'. By now you must have understood the target feature or value to be predicted is the Likes column which has been referred to as "reach" so far.
When Do people get more likes on a social media platform like Instagram?
When a User has more followers, then the post reaches out to more peoples and chances are more to get more likes. To identify a linear relationship in data and build a simple Machine Learning model and put your best foot forward toward Machine Learning.




**Q.3**

## News Category Dataset

Identify the type of news based on headlines and short descriptions


**About Dataset**

*Context*
** Please cite the dataset using the BibTex provided in one of the following sections if you are using it in your research, thank you! **

This dataset contains around 210k news headlines from 2012 to 2022 from HuffPost. This is one of the biggest news datasets and can serve as a benchmark for a variety of computational linguistic tasks. HuffPost stopped maintaining an extensive archive of news articles sometime after this dataset was first collected in 2018, so it is not possible to collect such a dataset in the present day. Due to changes in the website, there are about 200k headlines between 2012 and May 2018 and 10k headlines between May 2018 and 2022.

*Content*
Each record in the dataset consists of the following attributes:

- category: category in which the article was published.
- headline: the headline of the news article.
- authors: list of authors who contributed to the article.
- link: link to the original news article.
- short_description: Abstract of the news article.
- date: publication date of the article.
There are a total of 42 news categories in the dataset. The top-15 categories and corresponding article counts are as follows:

POLITICS: 35602

WELLNESS: 17945

ENTERTAINMENT: 17362

TRAVEL: 9900

STYLE & BEAUTY: 9814

PARENTING: 8791

HEALTHY LIVING: 6694

QUEER VOICES: 6347

FOOD & DRINK: 6340

BUSINESS: 5992

COMEDY: 5400

SPORTS: 5077

BLACK VOICES: 4583

HOME & LIVING: 4320

PARENTS: 3955

Inspiration
Can you categorize news articles based on their headlines and short descriptions?

Do news articles from different categories have different writing styles?

A classifier trained on this dataset could be used on a free text to identify the type of language being used.
